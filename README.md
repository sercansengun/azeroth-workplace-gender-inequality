Abstract:

In this study, we collect and analyze data from a massively multiplayer online game to explore the reflection of gendered profession bias in constructing the nar-ratives and societies of a virtual world. Gendered professions emerge when gender bias or stereotypes designate a profession or a job to be more suitable for a cer-tain gender. This type of bias can act as a gatekeeper, especially for women, to various job fields such as STEM. While in the physical world, superficial explana-tions can be offered for the gender divide for some jobs (e.g., the lack of female lumberjacks might be attributed to average upper body strength of genders, etc.), there is very little reason (physical or otherwise) for a similar gender divide to oc-cur within the narratives of virtual worlds or societies other than real-life bias per-meating to design decisions. We collect and analyze data from the popular online multiplayer game World of Warcraft (WoW) to illustrate how gendered profes-sions bias affects the design decisions in the game and might contribute to rein-forcing our real-life stereotypes.
